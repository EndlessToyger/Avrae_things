## What is this?

This is all the current code and the upcoming updates to the codebase for the [paladin things](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/5ff1b9ec032beeab19695bb9) collection. This is also the place to open Push requests and issues if there is any need for them.

### What is currently automated?

Well see for yourself mostly but all the official subclasses have their own automation(on any possible abilities). I am working on a full alias to allow pretty much any homebrew subclass to function too, if you write the json or Yaml file for it. YOu can check out the progress in the version_2 branch.

### what if there is a feature you want?

Well, ask me. depending on your level of friendlyness and my time availability I might add it or not.
